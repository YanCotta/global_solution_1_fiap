ANHANGÁ Subsystem - Mesh Communication Network

This module defines the AnhangaMeshNetwork class, responsible for
maintaining resilient emergency communications through adaptive mesh networking.

                                       determining priority levels, and optimizing
                                       routing decisions based on message urgency.
        - self.routing_optimizer: An algorithm (e.g., based on ant colony optimization
                                 or genetic algorithms) that finds optimal paths through
                                 the mesh network considering factors like latency,
